# ip-lookup-tool

A small, open-source IP lookup utility for learning and network administration.  
It performs passive lookups (geolocation, ASN, reverse DNS, WHOIS lookups via public services). It does **not** perform port or vulnerability scans.

## Usage
- Configure your own API keys for any third-party geolocation/WHOIS providers (do not commit keys).
- The tool respects rate limits and is intended for legitimate administration and research only.
